**Security Policy**

Thank you for taking the time to improve the security of this project. We value your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you discover.

Supported Versions

Version	Supported
main	✅ (latest release)
others	❌ (no active support at this time)

We only actively maintain and patch the latest commit on the main branch. If you discover an issue in an older branch, please consider verifying it also exists in main.

Reporting a Vulnerability
	1.	Contact: If you discover a vulnerability, please report it by emailing sooraj46@gmail.com. Please do not disclose it publicly in a GitHub issue.
	2.	Details: When reporting, please be sure to include:
	•	A description of the vulnerability.
	•	Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept (if available).
	•	Any details about the environment or configuration needed to trigger the issue.
	•	The impact of the vulnerability and/or any suggested fixes.
	3.	Response Time: We will aim to respond to vulnerability reports within 3 business days, with further steps or requests for additional detail.

Disclosure Policy
	•	We ask that you do not publish details about the vulnerability until we have had a chance to investigate and address it.
	•	Once the fix is in place, we will coordinate a public disclosure with credit to you for the discovery if you desire.

Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you are contributing code:
	•	Remove or mask any secrets or credentials before committing code.
	•	Use environment variables or a secrets manager (rather than hardcoding credentials).
	•	Keep dependencies updated (e.g., Python libraries, RabbitMQ client libraries).
	•	Follow secure coding best practices (e.g., validate user input, sanitize log output, etc.).
